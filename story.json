        "narrative": "You awaken to the creaking and groaning of timbers, as if the very bones of the ship are engaged in a comedic dialogue with the sea. Your eyes adjust to the dim light filtering through the gaps in the wooden planks that form your makeshift cell. You're aboard the HMS Chuckle, a pirate ship infamous not for its plundering or pillaging, but for its peculiar penchant for puns, pranks, and all things preposterously funny. The air is thick with the smell of salt, sweat, and a hint of banana cream pieâ€”likely from last night's dessert duel. Your cell is a veritable museum of comedy history, with graffiti jokes scrawled on the walls in various states of hilarity and legibility. A parrot, resplendent in its kaleidoscopic plumage, is perched on a wooden stand near the cell door. It eyes you with a mixture of curiosity and judgment, as if assessing whether you're worthy of its comedic wisdom. 'Polly wants a punchline!' it squawks, flapping its wings in a dramatic fashion that would make any Shakespearean actor green with envy.",
